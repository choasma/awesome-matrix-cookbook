My study notes of Matrix Cook book ([[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixmciLhZvtAhU-63MBHT5ZDVcQFjABegQIBBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ics.uci.edu%2F~welling%2Fteaching%2FKernelsICS273B%2FMatrixCookBook.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1CtNS3lRl-5H1oZbFqKlJr][link]]). This repository aims at providing
the proof of the derivatives in the book, having huristic understanding of
matrix derivative.

This is still the early stage of working on this project. The motivation of this
is I'd like to put all references from the internet in one place, as well as
practice my math skill. Feel free to correct the answer that I have provided.

* Usage

I have a hard time to work on math rendering in github. But instead I would
render all org files into htmls. So you could clone the project and open up the
html with the browser.
