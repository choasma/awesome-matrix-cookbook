* Awesome-matrix-cookbook

My study notes of Matrix Cook book ([[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixmciLhZvtAhU-63MBHT5ZDVcQFjABegQIBBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ics.uci.edu%2F~welling%2Fteaching%2FKernelsICS273B%2FMatrixCookBook.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1CtNS3lRl-5H1oZbFqKlJr][link]]). 

This repository aims at providing the proof of the derivatives in the book, 
having huristic understanding of matrix derivative.

This is still in the early stage of development. The motivation of this is I'd
like to put all references from the internet in one place, as well as refresh
my math skill for my PhD study. Feel free to correct the answer that I have provided.

Your opinions are welcome! I'm a little learner in this world.

* Usage

I have a hard time to work on math rendering in github. But instead I would
render all org files into htmls. So you could clone the project and open up the
html with the browser. Your entry point is =./doc/preface.html=. In short, 



#+begin_quote
open ./doc/preface.html
#+end_quote

Or if you use Emacs editor ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][link]]) together with proper installations (e.g.,
org-mode, mathjax, ...), you can see the better visualization in org file.

* Visualization
There are two ways to see this project. It seems like Github does not support
math rendering in the readme file, and I don't really want to push the rendered
image all the time. So instead the htmls or emacs could be your choice.

#+begin_quote
git clone https://github.com/choasma/awesome-matrix-cookbook.git
#+end_quote

Then choose one of these methods,

** html
Just see each html file that you're interested in. Your entry point is

=./doc/preface.html=

** emacs with mathjax
You need to install Emacs though ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][link]]) with proper mathjax. If you are
interested please let me know the quick setup. Your entry point is

=./doc/preface.org=

* Project Structure

Here is the repository structure

#+begin_src python
root ┬ doc # the pages with derivation
     │  ├ chxx-xxx # each chapter
     │  ├ ... # each chapter
     │  ├ preface.html # project entry point
     │  └ preface.org # and its source
     └ source # some python/julia scripts here 
#+end_src

* Plan

The following chapters of this repository are basically following the matrixcook
book's outline, except ch00, and ch11 that I created manually for handy
usage. (I'm quite lazy to google them all the time because my brain has less
neurons ... )

- [ ] INPROGRESS ch00-cheat: the handy documentation about the math basic usage
- [ ] INPROGRESS ch01-basic
- [ ] INPROGRESS ch02-derivatives
- [ ] TODO ch03-inverse
- [ ] TODO ch04-compmat
- [ ] TODO ch05-sol-and-decomp
- [ ] TODO ch06-stat-and-prob
- [ ] TODO ch07-mul-dist
- [ ] TODO ch08-gaussian
- [ ] TODO ch09-special
- [ ] TODO ch10-func
- [ ] INPROGRESS ch11-others: something like deep learning related topics
